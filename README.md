• Built a turn-based Battleship game using Javascript, allowing players to place and attack opponent ships.
• Developed an algorithm that tracks the success of previous attacks to prioritize targeting adjacent cells.
• Implemented dynamic cell selection and filtering techniques, including calculating valid adjacent cells and fallback
to random valid cells to enhance strategic decision-making and adaptability.

Test out the game for yourself! https://patrickly1.github.io/Battleship/
